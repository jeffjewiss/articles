# Creating a Photo Portfolio with Ember

* why use Ember?
  - build tools and deploy is easy and standard
  - routes are structured for adding galleries or pages
  - add-ons already exist for animation, build optimization, etc.

* reading exif metadata from photos

* easy styles with postcss and tacyons

* animations with liquid-fire

* lazy load photos

* day/night theme with CSS variables
